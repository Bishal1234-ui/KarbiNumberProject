# Karbi Language Number Detection


## Overview

The Karbi Language Number Detection project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately identify numeric characters in the Karbi language. Karbi is a regional language spoken in North East India, and finding data sets for this language can be quite challenging. To overcome this limitation, we've leveraged image generation techniques to create a diverse dataset for training our model.

## Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network:** We've implemented a CNN architecture tailored for character recognition tasks.
- **Data Augmentation:** Image generation techniques are used to expand the dataset and improve the model's robustness.
- **High Accuracy:** Our model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 91%.
