		KARBI NUMBER DETECTION MODEL USING CNN
		OWNER : BISHAL HAZARIKA



1. The train folder has total 2440 images ( 244 for each class )
2. The test folder has 610 images ( 61 for each class )
3. Go to the CNN_Model.ipynb file --- > This is the training model. The model is
  trained by CNN using Tensorflow
4. Saving the trained model as KarbiClass.h5
5. Using the .h5 file to predict images in GUI_detection.ipynb
6. The Drawing screen or GUI is made using 'tkinter' (a GUI library for python)
7. Draw any number and close the screen to see the output results


NOTE: To re-train the model upload all the files to google colaboratory and den run each cell of the CNN_model.ipynb
